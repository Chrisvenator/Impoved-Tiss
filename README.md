## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Basic Settings

**Current Semester** - Set this to your active semester (e.g., "2025S" for Summer 2025, "2025W" for Winter 2025). This
affects all semester-based links and highlighting.

```javascript
const currentSemester = "2022W";
```

**Automatic Login** - Enable/disable automatic login flow. Set to `false` if you want to manually log in.

```javascript
const automaticLogin = true;
```

### Study Programs

```javascript
const currentStudium = new Map([
    ["Bachelorstudium Software & Information Engineering", "https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/..."],
    ["Bachelorstudium Informatik", "https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/..."],
    ["Masterstudium Data Science", "https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/..."]
]);
```

**Your Study Programs** - Add your enrolled study programs with their curriculum URLs:

- Key: Display name of the study program
- Value: TISS curriculum URL (find this by navigating to your study program in TISS and copying the URL)

### Study Program Highlighting

```javascript
const highlightCurrentStudium = true;
```

**Highlight Current Programs** - When viewing the study codes page, your configured study programs will be highlighted
in light green.

### Completed Courses

```javascript
const completedLVANames = [
    "Einf√ºhrung in die Programmierung 1",
    "Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen",
    // ... add your completed courses
];
```

**Completed Courses List** - Add the exact names of courses you've completed. These will be:

- Highlighted in light green in the curriculum view

**Tip:** Copy course names directly from TISS to ensure exact matching.
